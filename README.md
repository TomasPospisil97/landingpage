Hello everyone, this is my langing page code.
Still in progress.
It is my playground.
I will let you know once it will be finished.

#GENERAL_INFO
My goal is to make my personal portfolio web page. 
I want to include all the necessary information on one page - easy to read, easy to connect.
I partially searched for inspiration on internet, but at the same time I want it to look unique in the certain way.
Below you will find my progress in points, which refers to certain parts of the web page and also my personal notes.
Also you can check my commit history to track my progress.
